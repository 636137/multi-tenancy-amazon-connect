# Nova Sonic to Nova Sonic 🎭

**Two AI voices having a real conversation** - using Amazon Nova Sonic bidirectional streaming.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/placeholder

## What This Is

This project demonstrates **pure AI-to-AI voice conversation** using Amazon Nova Sonic:

- **Customer AI** (Sarah, female voice): Calling about a suspicious $47.99 charge
- **Agent AI** (Alex, male voice): Customer service representative helping resolve the issue

Both AIs are completely autonomous Nova Sonic instances - they listen to each other and respond naturally.

## 🎧 Hear It

Run the demo and hear two AIs talk:

```bash
# Record conversation, then play it back
python voice_tester/sonic_live_playback.py
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### One-Command Setup

```bash
# Automated setup - checks everything and installs dependencies
python deploy_nova_sonic.py

# Or run with demo
python deploy_nova_sonic.py --run-demo
```

### Manual Setup

**Requirements:**
- **Python 3.12+** (required for AWS Smithy SDK)
- **AWS Account** with Nova Sonic access enabled in Bedrock
- **macOS/Linux** with audio output

```bash
# 1. Create Python 3.12 virtual environment
python3.12 -m venv .venv312
source .venv312/bin/activate

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install boto3 sounddevice numpy
pip install aws-sdk-bedrock-runtime

# 3. Configure AWS credentials
aws configure
# Or set environment variables:
# export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
# export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...

# 4. Run the demo!
python voice_tester/sonic_live_playback.py
```

## 🤖 Copilot Agent Skill

## 🔧 Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Bootstrap**: Customer's opening line uses Polly TTS (one sentence to start)
2. **Agent Responds**: Nova Sonic (Matthew voice) hears customer, generates response
3. **Customer Responds**: Nova Sonic (Tiffany voice) hears agent, responds
4. **Loop**: Audio routes between two Nova Sonic instances

```
Customer Nova Sonic  ←→  Agent Nova Sonic
   (Tiffany voice)         (Matthew voice)
```

### Audio Specs

- **Input**: 16kHz, 16-bit, mono PCM
- **Output**: 24kHz, 16-bit, mono PCM
- Resampling handled automatically when routing between instances

### Available Voices

| Voice | Gender | Accent |
|-------|--------|--------|
| matthew | Male | US English |
| tiffany | Female | US English |
| amy | Female | UK English |

### Key Discovery: VAD

Nova Sonic uses Voice Activity Detection (VAD). You must send ~2 seconds of silence after speech for the AI to recognize the turn is complete.
